# digitaledition
A Wordpress theme for longform scholarly content.

Digital Edition is a WordPress theme for academics. It is designed with the publication of longform content in mind, but it does just as well publishing shorter projects, like copies of journal articles or original blog posts. It is particularly good at organizing work into chapters, and allowing seriatim navigation. Check out the example of Poe’s The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym at http://www.thedigitalpoe.org/

It has native support for mobile and tablet display, dual author/editor footnoting, automatic paragraph numbering to make citation a breeze, as well as a whole host of other features.

And best of all: it is free and open-source. You don’t forfeit the rights to your content to anyone when you use the platform.

Digital Edition was not intended to enable the reproduction of a book’s physical state on the web. Rather, its goal is to enable the creation of a digital iteration of a text (i.e. an edition), or a new digitally-native text. This means that it does not allow for pagination or fixed-text layouts. Moreover, it does not support facsimile reproduction except as embedded images or PDFs.

The platform was developed as a modification of the WordPress theme Twenty Fifteen, a theme from the makers of the WordPress platform. What that means is you can be sure it will be well-supported and easy to adapt to the needs of your project.

The theme is developed and maintained by Eric McDaniel, an English graduate student at the University of Virginia.
